# Diabetes Patient Readmission Prediction - Regression, Classification and Clustering

Diabetes is the leading cause of death in the world. Roughly 422 million people have diabetes. There are three major types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. Type 2 is the most common type of diabetes and is thought to be preventable! While the leading cause of death, with identification and proper management of diabetes most individuals can lead happy and healthy lives. The key to manageable diabetes is often early detection and proper treatment.

The first task of this project is a comprehensive analysis that evaluates our ability to predict readmission to the hospital for diabetes using advanced classification techniques: KNN, Random Forest, SVM, and XG Boost. The second task of this project provided deep analysis to predict the amount of time a patient spent in the hospital for their condition using effective regression techniques: KNN, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. The third task of this project is to use unsupervised learning techniques to cluster our diabetes dataset to glean new information and previously unseen patterns. The following techniques were used for the clustering task: KMeans, MiniBatchKMeans, GaussianMixture, AgglomerativeClustering, and DBSCAN. Our dataset does not align patients to a specific type of diabetes. Our hypothesis for the last task is that our data will naturally cluster itself to showcase the different types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, gestational, pre-diabetes, and lastly no diabetes. Our findings in this report lead us not only to validate the hypothesis above but provide even more insight into diabetes type with severity of diabetes.

For this work was used data set presented by Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetes-hospital-readmission/data
